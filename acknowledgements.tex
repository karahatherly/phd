    \TODO{THANKS}
    % It's a common aphorism to state that research outcomes 'stand on the shoulders of giants', 
    % referring to all the research and hard work that the outcomes build upon. It's definitely
    % true, however I'd like to personally thank those rarely recognised: the carers, the cleaners,
    % the cooks, the friends and family, the physiotherapists, the detectives, therapists,
    % and all of the people who form a support group around a person. It takes a
    % village to raise a child, and the same goes for a research project. In both cases, there's a
    % lot of thankless, gruelling work, which might sound similar to doing a PhD, but you don't get
    % a certificate and floppy hat at the end.
    % 
    % In no specific order, I'd like to thank the following people for their help and support: Kara Hatherly,
    % Debbie \& Geoff Fear, Biara Webster, Ryan Williams and his
    % team, and Patricia Durning. I wouldn't have finished this project without you. 
    % 
    % I thank my supervisor, Gernot Heiser, for encouraging me, giving me the time I needed, and ultimately
    % proving the support that led to me actually finish. My co-supervisor, Kevin Elphinstone, for being drawn
    % into hours of whiteboard discussion. Additionally all of the students, engineers and
    % reseachers who have helped at some point or another: Aaron Carrol, Thomas Sewell, Adrian
    % Danis, David Greenaway, Kent MacLeod and Hesham Almatary. 
    %
    % Matthew Fernandez, Rafal Kolanski, and Joel Beeren get a special thanks not only for help with
    % the work, but for supporting me in the lab, and the pub, and being my friends, you were a huge factor
    % in keeping me sane. 
    %
    % Proof readers: Robert Sison, Peter Chubb, 
    %
    % Finally, I'd like to thank the team at iMove physiotherapy, who have helped me stay fit and
    % prevent serious injury through their excellent care and advice. Even when I didn't do my
    % exercises.
